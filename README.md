# planner-class
This class is meant to mimic the functionality of a planner in real life, with the ability to add events to a running planner dictionary that can then be retrieved to print out a formatted version of the planner. There is also a method to mark events/tasks as completed by using a strikethrough unicode symbol to mimic the appearance of something being struck through to be marked as done. Furthermore, it includes a method that simply prints a list of all current tasks as a todo list.
